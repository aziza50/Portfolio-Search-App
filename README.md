Which AI tools did you use?

ChatGpt.

Example prompts I tried?

1. Help me style this grid class and card such that the cards are evenly spaced and the card is split into two columns.
2. *Input error from console where serializer input would not match the output of my frontend.
3. How would I use react hooks like useState and useEffect. 

What AI helped with?

Because AI is really good at css, I would ask it to style the grid to make it nice or make my form nicer. It helps me avoid a lot of 
boiler-plate code. I've also used it as a guide to help me write serializers code on the backend as it was confusing and I've never worked with 
Django REST framework before. I've also used AI to navigate react hooks and ensure the states were set correctly. 

Though AI is very familiar with React and Django, it sometimes makes mistakes when I input error outputs from the console. Many errors may be the root cause of the error so a lot of times I had to go back and see what data the front-end was sending and see if it matches the serializer expected input for example.
